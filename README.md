# Create A Token

This Solidity program is a simple program that demonstrates the introduction of data types, mapping in solidity, functions and conditional Statements in the Solidity programming language. The purpose of this program is to get a feel for how functions, conditional statements and loops work and how these are used.

## Description

This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has a two function one is mint function and another one is burn function. This program can be used as a stepping stone for more complex projects in the future.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (here, i've saved with Token.sol). Copy and paste the required code into the file.


To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.4" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile Token.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "Token" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the various functions. Click on the "Token" contract in the left-hand sidebar, and then click on the given function. Finally, click on the "transact" button to execute the function and retrieve the result.
